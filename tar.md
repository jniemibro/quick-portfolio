#History

---

The Arcane Relics has been in the works since about 2009. We originally called it our White Whale, (little did I know how well-suited that name is for the scope of this project…) however the current version of the game has been from a fresh start in 2014, adding the split-screen multiplayer and more physics-reliant use of ragdolls and weapons hitting specific limbs. We were Greenlit on Steam in 2015 and released v0.2 at the beginning of 2020.

At first, the game targeted iOS devices and was only single-player. We used this project primarily for learning, experimenting on whatever we wanted to try to make. Here some old screenshots:

This version we call the "classic", as we got alot of features in, though buggy. I was still using unityscript at this time.
