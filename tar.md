## History

---

_The Arcane Relics_ has been in the works for quite a while, since about 2009... However, the current version of the game has been from a fresh start in 2014, adding the split-screen multiplayer and more physics-reliant use of ragdolls and weapons hitting specific limbs.

At first, the game targeted iOS devices and was only single-player. We used this project primarily for learning, experimenting on whatever features we wanted to try to make. Here are some old screenshots:

Started using C# in this version


<br>
This version we call the "classic", as we got alot of features in, though buggy. I was still using unityscript at this time.
